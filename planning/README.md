## Planning Process

### Main Plan  

- **As a User (AAU)**, I want to sign up for an account and sign in, so that I can access my personal user profile and manage my bucket list activities.  
- **AAU**, I want an easy and consistent way to navigate through the site, whether I am signed in or not. I need to quickly access options to sign up, sign in, view my list, or sign out, depending on my current status.  
- **AAU**, I need a dedicated page to view all activities in my list, so that I can easily manage, review, and track my bucket list items.  
- **AAU**, I want to easily find and click on an ‘Add New Activity’ link, which takes me to a form to add new activities to my list, including title, description, category, and optional photo.  
- **AAU**, after filling out the activity form, I want to submit it and receive confirmation that the item has been saved to my bucket list, with the correct status.  
- **AAU**, I need the ability to edit and delete items in my bucket list, so I have full control over managing and updating my stored activities.  
- **AAU**, I want to choose if my activity is in progress or has been completed, so that I can track my progress or mark it as finished.  
- **AAU**, I want to organize my bucket list into categories, such as travel, personal goals, or hobbies, to keep it structured and easy to navigate.  
- **AAU**, I want to be able to add a note or personal experience after completing an activity, so I can reflect on my journey and share my thoughts once the activity is finished.  
- **AAU**, I want the ability to upload a photo, once an activity is completed, to visually document my accomplishments.

### Advanced Plan (If I can)

- **AAU**, I want a "Washlist" feature that rewards me for completing an activity, marking it as "washed," and unlocking fun effects like badges or points for achieving milestones.  
- **AAU**, I want a shuffle feature that suggests the next activity for me to pursue, helping me pick my next goal when I'm unsure of what to tackle next.  
- **AAU**, I want to share my accomplishment to social media, to encourage others to pursue their dreams.
